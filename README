starlink.ndf is a Python extension to allow one to open NDF files inside
Python. Its a bit minimal at present, but is a start. To install it
you need to have the Python numerical array package "numpy", the starlink
software installed, the environment variable STARLINK_DIR defined 
and then it is a matter of the usual python installation procedure, e.g.

python setup.py install

or 

python setup.py install --prefix=<your specific installation directory>
