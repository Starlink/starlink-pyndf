starlink.ndf is a Python extension to allow one to open NDF files
inside Python. Its a bit minimal at present, but is a start. To
install it you need to have the Python numerical array package
"numpy", the starlink-pyhds package installed, the starlink software
suite installed, the environment variable STARLINK_DIR defined and
then it is a matter of the usual python installation procedure, e.g.

python setup.py install

or 

python setup.py install --prefix=<your specific installation directory>
